  <h3><FONT COLOR = "red">Who I Am</FONT></h3>
  <p>I am currently working through my PhD in mathematics under Professor Paul Terwilliger. My research is in algebra and combinatorics, and while I am mainly a pure mathematician, I am considering both academic and industry jobs and am fascinated to see where the fields I am studying appear in data science and other applications. I completed my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in 2018, studying mathematics and computer science, and seeing the theory behind the technology of today is what has always intrigued me.</p>

  </h3>
<p>I've always been fond of things that make my brain work in its own way, such as sudoku puzzles and philosophy. Also, I tend to enjoy making charts and such, to the point that I have developed a hobby of making logic puzzles. Perhaps this can be converted into a career in data analysis, thereby converting a seemingly random interest of mine into something that can fundamentally change how we understand how the world works.

   <FONT COLOR = "blue">What I am Interested In</FONT>
  </h3>The mathematics of daily life has fascinated me since I was a small child. To this day I think of everything in a mathematical or numeric manner -- for instance, I think of the sentence "All cats are adorable" as
  $$\forall x (x \in \{Cats\} \rightarrow \exists y | Adores(y,x))$$
 <center> ∀x (x ∈ {Cats} ⇒ ∃y | Adores(y,x)). </center>
Causal inference is one of many ways this can be achieved. One of my favorite phrases is "it's all connected," and this concept essentially gives a mathematical model of how this is true... sometimes
