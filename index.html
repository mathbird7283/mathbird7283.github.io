<h1>Owen Goff (solver of puzzles, he/him, cat enthusiast)</h1>
<p>I currently am working through my PhD in mathematics under Professor Paul Terwilliger. My research is in algebra and combinatorics, and while I am mainly a pure mathematician, I am considering both academic and industry jobs and am fascinated to see where the fields I am studying appear in data science and other applications.</p>
<p>I've always been fond of things that make my brain work in its own way...
