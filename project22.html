<h3>What the Project Is</h3>
<p>We all know how our lives changed on March 11, 2020. This was the day Sarah Palin was revealed on the Masked Singer, NBA player Rudy Gobert touched a bunch of microphones, and the writer of the Pendragon novels celebrated a milestone 64th birthday.

Oh, wait, and there was a deadly disease that on this day become a pandemic and kind of ruined our lives for over a year.

But what if it had never happened? What if it did happen but we didn't intervene? What if (in the USA) we intervened more strictly like in many countries in Asia, or let off everything more quickly like in New Zealand?

Listed here are twenty-three things that have happened since that fateful day.</p>

<h3>An Array of Questions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Would remote work still be popular?</li>
<li>Would George Floyd have died?</li>
<li>Would Siobhan Haughey still not have beaten Ariarne Titmus in the 200m free final  in Tokyo 2020?</li>
<li>Would Randy Arozarena have become a household name?</li>
<li> Would Taylor Swift have released an album in 2020? </li>
<li>Would Donald Trump have not been re-elected President of the United States?</li>
<li>Would we still have adopted better sanitizing practices and better mentality regarding staying home when ill?</li>
<li>Would any sort of 2021 labor shortage still have existed?</li>
<li>Would Fall Guys still be popular?</li>
<li>Would Inside Out 2 still exist?</li>
<li>Would Roe vs Wade still have been overturned?</li>
<li>Would the Webb telescope still have been launched?</li>
<li>Would the population of pigeons in the USA be higher or lower?</li>
<li>Would the Futurama reunion have still happened?</li>
<li>Would any of the most popular baby names of 2021 have been different?</li>
<li>Would Queen Elizabeth II have died?</li>
<li>Would I live in the apartment I currently live in?</li>
<li>Would I be enrolled in this class?</li>
<li>Would I have a significant other?</li>
<li>Would I still have traveled to Ireland in March 2022?</li>
<li>Would Russia still have invaded Ukraine?</li>
<li>Would everything be quite so expensive?</li>
<li>Would Zoom or Instacart still even exist as a company?</li>
</ol>

<h3>How Things Will Work</h3>
<p>In this project I wil analyze, using graphical methods (e.g. do-calculus and SWIGs) exactly how the pandemic and the measures we took in response to it, most likely, affected the answers to these questions -- also considering the <i>separate</i> question as to what would happen if we undid the pandemic as a concrete intervention.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of this project is to build a series of large causal graphs, and use d-separation to identify which of the above events are independent of the pandemic and/or the interventions used to combat it. My work towards answering these questions will make use of the results from Malinsky, Shpitser, and Richardson's <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/malinsky19b/malinsky19b.pdf">paper</a>. Three of note are as follows:</p>

Since most of our random variables are binary, and a few take on distinct numerical values, we can define a causal model with series of DAGs.

Many graphs in this project will be mixed, as there are pairs of happenstances (e.g. number of customers at a restaurant and likelihood it will shut down) that both affect each other. This implies the eistence of hidden variables.

Proper causal paths and path-specific effects will certainly appear == the pandemic and its preventative measures define a small number of sources, and there will be multiple paths from the sources to the answers to each of these questions.
