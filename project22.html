We all know how our life changed on March 11, 2020. This was the day Sarah Palin was revealed on the Masked Singer, and the writer of the Pendragon novels celebrated a milestone 64th birthday.

Oh, wait, there was a deadly disease that on this day become a pandemic and kind of ruined out lives for over a year.

But what if it never happened? What if it did happen but we didn't intervene? What if (in the USA) we intervened more strictly like in many countries in Asia, or let off more quickly like in New Zealand?

Listed here are twenty-three things that happened since that fateful day.

<ol type="1">
<li>Would remote work still exist?</li>
<li>Would George Floyd have died?</li>
<li>Would Siobhan Haughey still not have beaten Ariarne Titmus in the 200m free final  in Tokyo 2020?</li>
<li>Would Randy Arozarena have become a household name?</li>
<li>Would Donald Trump have been re-elected President of the United States?</li>
<li>Would we still have adopted better sanitizing practices and better mentality regarding staying home when ill?</li>
<li>Would any sort of 2021 labor shortage have still existed?</li>
<li>Would Fall Guys still be popular?</li>
<li>Would Inside Out 2 still exist?</li>
<li>Would Roe vs Wade still be overturned?</li>
<li>Would the Black Hole Picture have existed?</li>
<li>Would the population of pigeons in the USA be higher or lower?</li>
<li>Would the Futurama reunion have still happened?</li>
<li>Would any of the most popular baby names of 2021 have been different?</li>

<li>Would Russia still have invaded Ukraine?</li>

</ol>

In this project I wil analyze, using graphical methods (e.g. do-calculus and SWIGs) exactly how the pandemic and the measures we took in response to it, most likely, affected the answers to these questions -- also considering the <i>separate</i> question as to what would happen if we undid the pandemic as a concrete intervention.
