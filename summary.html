	<p>In this project, I looked at a remarkably specific question -- <b>Would Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena be a household name in the USA if the COVID-19 pandemic had never happened?</b></p>

<p>The primary techniques used to answer this question are:
<ul>
<li>Inverse probability weighing, direct standardization, and just a touch of linear regression
</li> 
<li> Analyzing data from recent MLB postseasons </li>
<li> A few fairly intuitive assumptions about human behavior </li>
<li> Identifying a series of expected values, assuming intervening on both whether the pandemic happened to begin with and whether we bothered to intervene.</li>
<li>Identifying monotonicity and Manski bounds, even though further sensitivity analysis was not exactly viable here.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>We found that the answer to this question is "probably yes", but our analysis is somewhat incomplete. A limitation is exactly how you measure "household name" in a manner that makes just as much sense in 1991 as in 2022. Additionally, a number of assumptions were made. A possible area of future work may be to find additional unmeasured confounding factors.</p>
