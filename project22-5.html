<h2> The Magic In Action </h2>h2>
<p>Consider the following SWIG, comprising seven discrete random variables.</p>

<img src="s.jpg" alt = "<== This One." width="155" height="155">


<p> The variables are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A is the variable that indicates whether the pandemic occurred (1 if it did, 0 if it did not).</li>
<li>B represents the degree of intervention by the government (0 = no intervention, 1 = minimal intervention, 2 = equivalent to USA response, 3 = extended stay-at-home-order, 4 = strictly enforced lockdown)</li>
<li>C represents whether Randy Arozarena is a houseehold name, to at least 75% of the extent that he is now. 1 if yes, 0 if no.</li>
<li>D represents the public's interest in professional sports. D=0 if it's closer to the 2020 level of interest, which was somewhat down from 2019, while D=1 if it's closer to the 2019 level of interest.</li>
<li>E represents which combination of teams played in the 2020 World Series. It takes on one of 225 possible values, identified as six-digit numbers via area codes (e.g. a World Series between the Yankees and the Cardinals would be E=212314).</li>
<li>F represents how social Americans are in 2020, on a continuous scale between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>G represents the number of home runs Randy Arozarena hit during the 2020 MLB postseason</li>
</ul>

<h3> What I'm Doing </h3>

<p>In this estimation step, I am working with a substantial number of assumptions. Most notably, <i>I am not accounting for every possible factor</i>, or my SWIG would become unmanageably large. I also reiterate that I am assuming defined potential outcomes and consistency here.</p>

<p>The primary technique I am using will be inverse probability weighing (which, you may recall, is equivalent to direct standardization if we are working with only discrete variables). Observe the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> A and B (collectively) satisfy backdoor criterial relative to (D,C), (E,C), (F,C), and (G,C) .</li>
<li>We assume the potential outcomes, e.g. C(g), are well-defined -- this is what we are looking to estimate.</li>
<li>Our causal estimand -- what we seek to find -- is E[C(a,b)] for various values of a and b, which are the experimental values of A and B. This can be found using inverse probability weighing; specifically by finding E[D(a,b)], for example, and then finding E[C|D=d].</li>
<li>Note also that E[C(a,b)] is, by inverse probability weighing, equal to E((1_{D=d}C)(P(D=d)|A,B)), so the key is finding propensity scores for D and other variables.
</ol>

<h3> How to find the expectations </h3>
<p> Here is an example we use a data set to estimate these values. To find E[D] -- i.e. the general population's degree of interest in professional sports - we consider the data set of television ratings for the World Series and the NBA Finals (Game 3 for both) as well as the Super Bowl. Begin with d=0 and add 1/3 if the rating of year n is higher than the mean of the two adjacent ratings (years n-1 and n+1), for each of the three sports, and then round to the nearest integer. Alternatively, we are picking the "best two out of three" in performance relative to the years before and after (using both sides is important as ratings for MLB and NBA games have steadily fallen over several decades)
</p>

<p>Additionally, In each year, we will consider the observed values of A and B as follows -- setting A to 1 if there was a major life distruption during the year (this, of course, is relative) and B to 1 if there were significant interventions on daily life as a result of it:</p>
<ol>
<li>A=1 in 1969 (Hong Kong Flu), 1974 (End of Vietnam War), 1981 (AIDS episdemic, MLB strike), 1989 (Tiananmen Square, Fall of the Berlin Wall), 1991 (Breakup of the Soviet Union), 1999 (Y2K Bug), 2001 (September 11 Attacks), 2009 (Swine Flu), 2020 and 2021 (COVID-19 Pandemic)</li>
<li>B=1 in 1981 (due to certain limitations caused by AIDS) and 2001 (due to security concerns). In 2020 B is equal to 2, as many things were cancelled or disallowed for the first time since 1945 (and the above data only goes back to 1968).</li>
</ol>

<p>We will consider the variables E and G simultaneously by considering the number of postseason games the Tampa Bay Rays would have played if the pandemic not occurred, or if intervention had been different. This depends entirely on B. I am assuming the following.

<ol>
<li>B=0 --> 162 game schedule, normal playoffs</li>
<li>B=1 --> 114 game schedule with varying attendance, normal playoffs</li>
<li>B=2 or B=3--> 60 game schedule with no fans, 16-team playoffs</li>
<li>B=4 --> no season</li>
</ol>

From here we clearly see that independent of A, E[C(a,4)]=0.  For the remaining cases, we use inverse probability weighing as above.

<p>What is the Data Being Used?</p>

The data sets used in this algorithm are largely theoretical. However, two notable sources of data make their appearances when we investigate the propensity scores of A and B relative to D, E, and G.

These are the Nielsen ratings of the Super Bowl, World Series, and NBA Finals (taken from www.sportsmediawatch.com), and a variety of win-loss records and success patterns of Major League Baseball teams over the last six season (taken from www.baseball-reference.com).

The former data are used to calculate E[D(a,b)], which is estimated by E_(54)[D(a,b)] where the 54 data poiints are the the years from 1969 to 2022. As we're dealing with discrete variables that take relatively few values, we may be able to model our intrmediate variables using an outcome regression -- each variable can likely be modeled as c_1a+c_2b+c_3+c_4ab). I suspect ab=0, but the issue is that this dataset is somewhat incomplete -- there's never been something like this in 77 years!

<h3> Results of hte Algorithm</h3>

<p>This is meant to answer a "butterfly effect" scenario, rather than planning for future events. That said, it works efficiently -- the hardest part is finding the probabilities in the postseason analysis, which is O(n^2+t) where n is the number of teams in Major League Baseball, and t is the number of years in our dataset.</p>

<h3> Why do we care? </h3>

<p>This matters to baseball (and sports in general) management, as it can show exactly how a player's career would, with highest probability, have played out if a significant interruption (e.g. a pandemic or World War II) and use this to make decisions. For example, merchandisers may be able to deduce if such an interruption will increas or decrease the player's popularity, and thus know how many jerseys to manufacture. This is fairly narrow but useful!</p>

<p> Applying this algorithm!</p>
I ran an algorithm to estimate the numebr of home runs Randy Arozarena would have hit during the postseason in a regular 162-game 2020 season. The algorithm worked the following way:
<ul>
<li>Extrapolate each team's 60-game record to 162 games. This is done by adding four times the record for each team's last 17 games (leading to 128 total games), along with 17 wins and 17 losses (as there will be some regression to the mean). For instance, the Seattle Mariners finished 27-33, and 8-9 in their last 17. Thus, in 162 games, they would be expected to win 27 + 4 * 8 + 17 = 76 games (and lose 86).</li>
<li>Identifyi the postseason bracket using regular playoff rules.</li>
<li>Check the record of each postseason term versus each other postseason team in 2020 postseason -- failing that, in 2020 -- failing that, in the last season they played each other. Put these records in a 10-by-10 numpy array. </li>
<li> Using iterated expectation and probability modeling to find the expected number of games the Rays played in the "pandemicless" 2020 postseason and the probability of making or winning the World Series.</li>
<li>Results: The Rays had a 8.66% chance to win the World Series and can be assumed to play approximately 9.02 games, of which they would win 4.50 and lose 4.52.</li>
<li> What did happen: The Rays won 11 postseason games and lost 9. Randy hit 5 home runs in games they won and 5 home runs in games they lost. Hence in a "normal postseason" he would be expected to his 4.557 home runs at current rates. Thus A stark difference!</li>
