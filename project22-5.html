<p>Consider the following SWIG, comprising seven discrete random variables.
<img src="s.jpg" alt = "<== This One." width="222" height="222">
</p>

<p>I am working with a substantial number of assumptions. Most notably I am not accounting for every possible factor, or my SWIG would become unmanageably large. I also reiterate that I am assuming defined potential outcomes and consistency here.</p>

<p>The primary technique I am using will be inverse probability weighing (which, you may recall, is equivalent to direct standardization if we are working with only discrete variables). Observe the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> A and B satisfy backdoor criterial relative to (C,G), (D,G), (E,G), and (F,G) (i.e. we can "go back from each variable through A or B" in the SWIG in all cases).</li>
<li>We assume the potential outcomes, e.g. G(c), are well-defined -- this is what we are looking to estimate.</li>
<li>Our causal estimand -- what we seek to find -- is E[G(a,b)] for various values of a and b, which are the experimental values of A and B. This can be found using inverse probability weighing; specifically by finding E[D(a,b)], for example, and then finding E[G|D=d].</li>
</ol>

<p> Here is an example we use a data set to estimate these values. </p>


<p>To find E[D] -- i.e. the general population's degree of interest in professional sports - we consider the data set of television ratings for the World Series and the NBA Finals (Game 3 for both) as well as the Super Bowl. Begin with d=0 and add 1/3 if the rating of year n is higher than the mean of the two adjacent ratings (years n-1 and n+1), for each of the three sports, and then round to the nearest integer. Alternatively, we are picking the "best two out of three" in performance relative to the years before and after (using both sides is important as ratings for MLB and NBA games have steadily fallen over several decades)
</p>

<p>In each year, we will consider the observed values of A and B as follows -- setting A to 1 if there was a major life distruption during the year (this, of course, is relative) and B to 1 if there were significant interventions on daily life as a result of it:</p>
<li>A=1 in 1969 (Hong Kong Flu), 1974 (End of Vietnam War), 1981 (AIDS episdemic, MLB strike), 1989 (Tiananmen Square, Fall of the Berlin Wall), 1991 (Breakup of the Soviet Union), 1999 (Y2K Bug), 2001 (September 11 Attacks), 2009 (Swine Flu), 2020 and 2021 (COVID-19 Pandemic)</li>

<li>B=1 in 1981 (due to certain limitations caused by AIDS) and 2001 (due to security concerns). In 2020 B is equal to 2, as many things were cancelled or disallowed for the first time since 1945 (and the above data only goes back to 1968).</li>

<p>Similarly, we consider E and F simultaneously by considering the number of postseason games the Tampa Bay Rays would have played if the pandemic not occurred, or if intervention had been different. This depends entirely on B. I am assuming the following.

<ol>
<li>B=0 --> 162 game schedule, normal playoffs</li>
<li>B=1 --> 114 game schedule with varying attendance, normal playoffs</li>
<li>B=2 or B=3--> 60 game schedule with no fans, 16-team playoffs</li>
<li>B=4 --> no season</li>
</ol>

From here we clearly see that independent of A, E[G(a,4)]=0.  For the remaining cases, we use inverse probability weighing:

E[Y(a)] = E[(P(A=a|X))^-1*1_(A=a)Y}]

What's worth investigating is E and F. First we assume B=0.

To estimate the expected number of postseason games played by the Tampa Bay Rays, ...

A screenshot of the code being used is attached at the bottom of the page.

Take the probability that each team in the postseason makes it as far as they do, base on postseason resultys, or if invalid the record in the previous full season (incvluding 2020) in which they played each other.

<p>What is the Data?</p>

The data sets used in this algorithm are largely theoretical. However, two notable sources of data make their appearances during D and E.

These data are:

The Nielsen ratings of the Super Bowl, World Series, and NBA Finals (taken from www.sportsmediawatch.com).

Additionally, a variety of win-loss records and patterns by major league baseball teams (from www.baseball-reference.com).

The former data are used to calculate E[D(a,b)], which is estimated by E_(54)[D(a,b)] where the 54 data poiints arte the years from 1969 to 2022. As we're dealing with discrete variables that take relatively few values, we may be able to model our intrmediate variables using an outcome regression -- each variable can likely be modeled as

c_1a+c_2b+c_3(+c_4ab)? I suspect ab=0, but the issue is that this fdataset is somewhat incomplete -- there's never been something like this in 77 years!
<p>General Steps</p>

<p>Identify the E[G(a,b)] for each value of a (which can be 0 or 1), and b (0 through 4). For each one, we consider the mediating variables C,D,E,F and use inverse probability weighing to calculate E[G] from an experimentall found E[G|c] (and the like), as well as a deduced E[C|a] (and the like), which can be viably estimated based on existing consumer habits in 2020.</p>
<p> Results of hte Algorithm</p>

<p>This is meant to answer a "butterfly effect" scenario, rather than planning for future events. That said, it works efficiently -- the hardest part is finding the probabilities in the world series, which is O(n^2) where n is the number of teams in Major League Baseball. The algorithm is consistent, and I actually will provide a code sample below.</p>

<p> Why do we care? </p>

This matters to baseball (and sports in general) management, as it can show exactly how a player's career would, with highest probability, have played out if a significant interruption (e.g. a pandemic or World War II) and use this to make decisions. For example, merchandisers may be able to deduce if such an interruption will increas or decrease the player's popularity, and thus know how many jerseys to manufacture. This is fairly narrow but useful!

<p> Applying this algorithm!</p>
I ran an algorithm to estimate the numebr of home runs Randy Arozarena would have hit during the postseason in a regular 162-game 2020 season. The algorithm worked the following way:
<ul>
<li>Extrapolate each team's 60-game record to 162 games. This is done by adding four times the record for each team's last 17 games (leading to 128 total games), along with 17 wins and 17 losses (as there will be some regression to the mean)</li>
<li>Identifying the postseason bracket using regular playoff rules.</li>
<li>Identifying the record of each term versus each other postseason team in 2020 postseason -- failing that, in 2020 -- failing that, in the last season they played each other </li>
<li> Using iterated expectation and probability modeling to find the expected number of games the Rays played in the "pandemicless" 2020 postseason and the probability of winning the world series.</li>
<li>Results: The Rays had a 8.66% chance to win the world series and can be assumed to play approximately 9.02 games, of which they would win 4.50 and lose 4.52.</li>
<li> What did happen: The Rays won 11 postseason games and lost 9. Randy hit 5 home runs in games they won and 5 home runs in games they lost. Hence in a "normal postseason" he would be expected to his 4.557 home runs at current rates. Thus A stark difference!</li>
